      <article>
        <p id="section-subtitle">Install Python:</p>
        <p>
          Visit the official Python website at python.org and download the latest version of Python for
          your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided.
        </p>

        <p id="section-subtitle">Set Up the Development Environment:</p>
        <p> After installing Python, you can use a text editor or an integrated
          development environment (IDE) to write your Python code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code,
          PyCharm, and IDLE (comes bundled with Python).
        </p>
        <p id="section-subtitle">Running Python Code:</p>
        <p>
          Interactive Shell: Python comes with an interactive shell called the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print
          Loop). Open
          the command prompt or terminal and type python to start the interactive shell. You can type Python code
          directly and see the results immediately.
        </p>
        <p>Executing Scripts:


          Write your Python code in a plain text file with a .py extension, such as my_script.py. Run
          the script by executing python my_script.py in the command prompt or terminal. Make sure you are in the same
          directory as the script.
          <b>Hello, World!</b>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your text editor or IDE and create a new Python file.
          Type the following code:
        <pre><code id="hello_world">
  print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Save the file as hello_world.py and run it using the methods described previously. You should see the output
          Hello, World! in the console.
        </p>

      <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
      <article>
        <p id="section-subtitle">Numeric Data Types:</p>
        <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. The data type of a variable determines the type of data
          it can hold. Python supports several built-in data types, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>int: Used to represent integer values.</li>
          <li>float: Used to represent floating-point numbers with decimal places.</li>
          <li>complex: Used to represent complex numbers in the form a + bj, where a and b are real numbers, and j is
            the imaginary unit.</li>

          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # Numeric data types
  age = 25  # int
  price = 9.99  # float
  complex_num = 2 + 3j  # complex</code>
        </pre>
          <p id="section-subtitle">String Data Type:</p>
          <li>str: Used to represent sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").
          </li>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # String data type
  name = "John Doe"  # str
  message = 'Hello, World!'  # str</code>
        </pre>
          <p id="section-subtitle">Boolean Data Type:</p>
          <li>bool: Used to represent either True or False.
          </li>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # Boolean data type
  is_valid = True  # bool
  is_empty = False  # bool</code>
        </pre>
          <p id="section-subtitle">List Data Type:</p>
          <li>list: Used to represent an ordered collection of elements enclosed in square brackets [ ].
          </li>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # List data type
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # list
  names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]  # list</code>
        </pre>
          <p id="section-subtitle">Tuple Data Type:</p>
          <li>tuple: Used to represent an ordered, immutable collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ( ).
          </li>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # Tuple data type
  coordinates = (10, 20)  # tuple
  colors = ("red", "green", "blue")  # tuple</code>
        </pre>
          <p id="section-subtitle">Dictionary Data Type:</p>
          <li>dict: Used to represent a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces { }.
            Example:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  # Dictionary data type
  person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}  # dict</code>
        </pre>

    <section class="main-section" id="control_flow">
      <header>Control Flow</header>
      <article>
        <p>Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. In Python, control flow is
          managed using conditional statements (if, elif, else) and looping statements (for, while).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conditional Statements:</li>
          <pre>
          <code>
  # Example 1: if statement
  x = 10
  if x > 0:
      print("x is positive")

  # Example 2: if-else statement
  x = -5
  if x > 0:
      print("x is positive")
  else:
      print("x is non-positive")

  # Example 3: if-elif-else statement
  x = 0
  if x > 0:
      print("x is positive")
  elif x < 0:
      print("x is negative")
  else:
      print("x is zero")</code>
        </pre>
          <li>Looping Statements:</li>
          <pre>
            <code>
  # Example 1: for loop
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)

  # Example 2: while loop
  count = 0
  while count < 5:
      print(count)
      count += 1</code>
          </pre>
          <li>Control Statements (break and continue):</li>
          <pre>
            <code>
  # Example 1: break statement
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      if fruit == "cherry":
          break
      print(fruit)

  # Example 2: continue statement
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  for number in numbers:
      if number % 2 == 0:
          continue
      print(number)</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code,
          improving code reusability, and promoting modular programming.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  # Example 1: Function without parameters
  def greet():
      print("Hello, there!")
      
  # Calling the function
  greet()  # Output: Hello, there!</code>
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, we define a function called <code>greet()</code> that doesn't take any parameters. When the function
          is called, it prints the message "Hello, there!".</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  # Example 2: Function with parameters
  def greet(name):
      print("Hello, " + name + "!")
      
  # Calling the function with arguments
  greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
  greet("Bob")    # Output: Hello, Bob!</code>
        </pre>
        <p>In this example, the function <code>greet()</code> takes a parameter name. When the function is called, we pass an
          argument to the function representing the name. The function then prints the personalized greeting using the
          provided name.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  # Example 3: Function with return statement
  def add_numbers(x, y):
      sum = x + y
      return sum
      
  # Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
  result = add_numbers(5, 3)
  print(result)  # Output: 8</code>
        </pre>
        <p>In this example, the function <code>add_numbers()</code> takes two parameters x and y and returns their sum using the
          return statement. We call the function with arguments 5 and 3 and store the returned value in the variable
          result. Finally, we print the value of result, which is 8.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="modules">
      <header>Modules</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, modules are files that contain Python code, including variables, functions, and classes. They
          allow you to organize and reuse code by breaking it into separate files.</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Importing a module
  import math
  Using functions from the math module
  print(math.sqrt(25)) # Output: 5.0
  print(math.pi) # Output: 3.141592653589793</code>
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, we import the math module using the <code>import</code> statement. The math module
          provides various mathematical functions and constants. We can use the functions from the math module by
          prefixing them with <code>math.</code>.</p>
        <pre>
<code>
  Example: Importing specific functions from a module
  from random import randint, choice

  Using the imported functions
  print(randint(1, 10)) # Output: Random integer between 1 and 10
  print(choice(['apple', 'banana'])) # Output: Randomly chosen element from the list</code>
        </pre>
        <p>In this example, we use the <code>from module import function</code> syntax to import specific functions from
          the random module. This allows us to use the functions directly without the need to prefix the module name.
        </p>
        <p>You can also create your own modules by defining Python code in separate files and importing them into your
          programs.</p>
        <pre>
<code>
  Example: Creating and using a custom module
  File: mymodule.py
  def greet(name):
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")

  File: main.py
  import mymodule

  mymodule.greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!</code>
      </pre>
        <p>In this example, we have a custom module called <code>mymodule.py</code> that contains a function
          <code>greet()</code>. We import the <code>mymodule</code> module into the <code>main.py</code> file and use
          the <code>greet()</code> function to print a greeting.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="file_handling">
      <header>File Handling</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, file handling allows you to work with files, such as reading from or writing to them. It enables
          you to perform tasks like opening files, reading their contents, writing data to them, and closing them when
          you're done.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of common file handling operations:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Opening and reading a file
  file = open("data.txt", "r")  # Open file in read mode
  Read the contents of the file
  contents = file.read()

  Print the contents
  print(contents)

  Close the file
  file.close()</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In the above example, we open a file named "data.txt" in read mode using the <code>open()</code> function. We
          read the contents of the file using the <code>read()</code> method and store them in the <code>contents</code>
          variable. Finally, we print the contents and close the file using the <code>close()</code> method.</p>
        <pre>
<code>
  Example: Writing to a file
  file = open("output.txt", "w") # Open file in write mode

  Write data to the file
  file.write("Hello, world!")

  Close the file
  file.close()</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In this example, we open a file named "output.txt" in write mode. We write the string "Hello, world!" to the
          file using the <code>write()</code> method. Finally, we close the file.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that when opening a file, you should always close it after you're done with it to free
          up system resources. Alternatively, you can use the <code>with</code> statement, which automatically takes
          care of closing the file for you:</p>
        <pre>
<code>
  Example: Using the with statement for file handling
  with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
  contents = file.read()
  print(contents)</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In this example, the <code>with</code> statement is used to open the file "data.txt" in read mode. The file
          is automatically closed at the end of the block, even if an exception occurs.</p>
        <p>File handling in Python offers various methods and modes for different file operations, such as reading line
          by line, appending to a file, and more. You can explore the Python documentation for more details on file
          handling operations.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="exception_handling">
      <header>Exception Handling</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, exception handling allows you to handle and recover from errors or exceptional situations that may
          occur during the execution of your code. By handling exceptions, you can prevent your program from crashing
          and provide alternative paths or error messages.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of how exception handling works:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Handling a specific exception
  try:
      # Code that may raise an exception
      result = 10 / 0  # Raises a ZeroDivisionError
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      # Code to handle the specific exception
      print("Cannot divide by zero!")</code>
    </pre>
        <p>In the above example, we have a <code>try</code> block that contains the code that may raise an exception. In
          this case, we attempt to divide the number 10 by zero, which raises a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>. We use
          the <code>except</code> block to specify the exception we want to handle. In this case, we handle the
          <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> and print a custom error message.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Handling multiple exceptions
  try:
      # Code that may raise exceptions
      result = int("abc")  # Raises a ValueError
      result = 10 / 0     # Raises a ZeroDivisionError
  except ValueError:
      # Code to handle ValueError
      print("Invalid input!")
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      # Code to handle ZeroDivisionError
      print("Cannot divide by zero!")</code>
    </pre>
        <p>In this example, we have multiple <code>except</code> blocks to handle different exceptions. The code inside
          the <code>try</code> block attempts to convert the string "abc" to an integer, which raises a
          <code>ValueError</code>. We also attempt to divide the number 10 by zero, which raises a
          <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>. Each exception is handled separately, and the appropriate error message is
          printed.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to handling specific exceptions, you can use a generic <code>except</code> block to catch any
          exception that is not explicitly handled:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Handling any exception
  try:
      # Code that may raise an exception
      result = 10 / 0  # Raises a ZeroDivisionError
  except Exception as e:
      # Code to handle any exception
      print("An error occurred:", str(e))</code>
    </pre>
        <p>In this example, the <code>except</code> block with the <code>Exception</code> keyword is used to handle any
          exception that may occur. The <code>as e</code> part allows you to access the exception object and obtain
          information about the error. In this case, we print a generic error message along with the error details.</p>
        <p>Exception handling in Python provides flexibility in handling different types of errors and implementing
          appropriate error-handling logic. It helps in creating robust and reliable code that gracefully handles
          unexpected situations.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="classes_and_objects">
      <header>Classes and Objects</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that an
          object of that class will have. An object is an instance of a class, and it can have its own unique data and
          functionality.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of a class and its object:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
    # Example: Creating a class
    class Car:
        def __init__(self, make, model, year):
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
            self.year = year

        def drive(self):
            print(f"Driving the {self.make} {self.model}!")

    Creating an object of the Car class
    my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model S", 2022)

    Accessing object properties
    print(my_car.make) # Output: Tesla
    print(my_car.model) # Output: Model S
    print(my_car.year) # Output: 2022

    Calling object methods
    my_car.drive() # Output: Driving the Tesla Model S!</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In the above example, we define a class called <code>Car</code> using the <code>class</code> keyword. The
          <code>Car</code> class has three properties: <code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, and <code>year</code>. The
          <code>init()</code> method is a special method called the constructor, which is executed when a new object is
          created. It initializes the object's properties.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>drive()</code> method is a function defined within the class. It can be called on an object of the
          <code>Car</code> class and performs a specific action.
        </p>
        <p>We create an object <code>my_car</code> of the <code>Car</code> class by invoking the class as if it were a
          function, passing the required arguments to the constructor.</p>
        <p>We can access the properties of the object using the dot notation, such as <code>my_car.make</code>,
          <code>my_car.model</code>, and <code>my_car.year</code>. We can also call the methods of the object, such as
          <code>my_car.drive()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Classes and objects provide a way to organize and encapsulate data and related functionality, enabling the
          creation of complex systems and code reusability.</p>

        <p>In Python, libraries and packages are essential for extending the functionality of the language. They provide
          pre-written code and modules that can be imported into your programs, saving you time and effort in
          implementing common tasks and functionalities.</p>
        <p>A library is a collection of modules, while a module is a single file containing Python code. Modules can
          contain functions, classes, variables, and other objects that can be used in your program.</p>
        <p>Python's standard library comes with a wide range of modules that cover various areas, such as math, file
          I/O, networking, and more. These modules are readily available for use and can be imported using the
          <code>import</code> statement.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of importing and using a module from the standard library:</p>
        <pre>
      <code>
  # Example: Using the math module
  import math
  Using functions from the math module
  print(math.sqrt(25)) # Output: 5.0
  print(math.sin(math.pi/2)) # Output: 1.0</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In this example, we import the <code>math</code> module using the <code>import</code> statement. We can then
          access the functions and constants provided by the module using the dot notation, such as
          <code>math.sqrt()</code> and <code>math.sin()</code>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the standard library, there are numerous third-party libraries and packages available for
          Python. These libraries are developed by the Python community and cover a wide range of domains, such as web
          development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.</p>
        <p>To use third-party libraries, you need to install them using a package manager like <code>pip</code> and then
          import them into your program. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
<code>
  Example: Using a third-party library
  import requests

  Making a HTTP GET request using the requests library
  response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  print(response.status_code) # Output: 200</code>
  </pre>
        <p>In this example, we import the <code>requests</code> library, which is a popular library for making HTTP
          requests. We use the <code>requests.get()</code> function to send a GET request to a specified URL and store
          the response in the <code>response</code> variable.</p>
        <p>Libraries and packages greatly enhance the capabilities of Python, allowing you to leverage existing code and
          solutions to build powerful and efficient applications.</p>
